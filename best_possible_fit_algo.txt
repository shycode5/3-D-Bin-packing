1. Order all boxes by volume:
   - Retrieve the dimensions of each box.
   - Calculate the volume of each box (length * width * height).
   - Sort the boxes in descending order based on their volumes.

2. Space partitioning:
   - Initialize a pallet or container with given dimensions.
   - Divide the available space into smaller regions to accommodate boxes.
   - Maintain a data structure (e.g., grid or tree) to represent the partitioned space.

3. Generate alternate paths:
   - Create a graph representation of the partitioned space.
   - Generate alternate paths from the starting point to the destination within the graph.
   - Consider different strategies like breadth-first search (BFS) or A* search to find efficient paths.

4. Depth-First Search (DFS):
   - Use a DFS algorithm to explore different packing configurations.
   - Start with an empty packing configuration.
   - Iterate over the sorted boxes by volume.
   - For each box, recursively try to place it in all possible positions while adhering to constraints (e.g., no overlap with existing boxes).
   - Keep track of the best configuration found during the search.

5. Find Max:
   - Compare the different packing configurations generated by DFS.
   - Identify the configuration with the maximum number of packed boxes or maximum space utilization.
   - This configuration represents the best packing solution found so far.

6. Simulated Annealing to mutate the order:
   - Use the Simulated Annealing algorithm to mutate the order of the boxes based on their volumes.
   - Define an initial order of the boxes.
   - Calculate the cost or objective function based on the maximum number of packed boxes or space utilization.
   - Generate a new order by swapping the positions of two boxes.
   - Calculate the new cost or objective function for the new order.
   - Accept or reject the new order based on a probability distribution.
   - Repeat the mutation process with different temperature values to explore the search space.

7. Retry:
   - Iterate the process from step 4 (DFS) to step 6 (Simulated Annealing) for multiple retries.
   - Each retry can start with a different initial order or different search parameters.
   - Keep track of the best packing configuration found across all retries.
   - Repeat the process until a satisfactory packing solution is obtained or a termination condition is met.
